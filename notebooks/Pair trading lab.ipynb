    "# Pairs Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs trading is a nice example of a strategy based on mathematical analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The principle is as follows:\n",
    "Let's say you have a pair of securities X and Y that have some underlying economic link. An example might be two companies that manufacture the same product, for example Pepsi and Coca Cola. You expect the spread (ratio or difference in prices) between these two to remain constant with time. However, from time to time, there might be a divergence in the spread between these two pairs. The divergence within a pair can be caused by temporary supply/demand changes, large buy/sell orders for one security, reaction for important news about one of the companies, and so on. When there is a temporary divergence between the two securities, i.e. one stock moves up while the other moves down, the pairs trade would be to short the outperforming stock and to long the underperforming one, betting that the \"spread\" between the two would eventually converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by constructing an artificial example."

    "### How to make a pairs trade?\n",
    "Because two cointegrated time series (such as X and Y above) drift towards and apart from each other, there will be times when the spread is high and times when the spread is low. We make a pairs trade by buying one security and selling another. This way, if both securities go down together or go up together, we neither make nor lose money — we are market neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to X and Y above that follow Y = ⍺ X + e, such that ratio (Y/X) moves around it’s mean value ⍺, we make money on the ratio of the two reverting to the mean. In order to do this we’ll watch for when X and Y are far apart, i.e ⍺ is too high or too low:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Going Long the Ratio This is when the ratio ⍺ is smaller than usual and we expect it to increase. In the above example, we place a bet on this by buying Y and selling X.\n",
    "* Going Short the Ratio This is when the ratio ⍺ is large and we expect it to become smaller. In the above example, we place a bet on this by selling Y and buying X.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note </b> that we always have a “hedged position”: a short position makes money if the security sold loses value, and a long position will make money if a security gains value, so we’re immune to overall market movement. We only make or lose money if securities X and Y move relative to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Data to find securities that behave like this\n",
    "The best way to do this is to start with securities you suspect may be cointegrated and perform a statistical test. If you just run statistical tests over all pairs, you’ll fall prey to multiple comparison bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Multiple comparisons bias </b> is simply the fact that there is an increased chance to incorrectly generate a significant p-value when many tests are run, because we are running a lot of tests. If 100 tests are run on random data, we should expect to see 5 p-values below 0.05. If you are comparing n securities for co-integration, you will perform n(n-1)/2 comparisons, and you should expect to see many incorrectly significant p-values, which will increase as you increase. To avoid this, pick a small number of pairs you have reason to suspect might be cointegrated and test each individually. This will result in less exposure to multiple comparisons bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s try to find some securities that display cointegration. Let’s work with a basket of US large cap tech stocks — in S&P 500. These stocks operate in a similar segment and could have cointegrated prices. We scan through a list of securities and test for cointegration between all pairs. It returns a cointegration test score matrix, a p-value matrix, and any pairs for which the p-value was less than 0.05. This method is prone to multiple comparison bias and in practice the securities should be subject to a second verification step. Let’s ignore this for the sake of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We include the market benchmark (SPY) in our data — the market drives the movement of so many securities that often you might find two seemingly cointegrated securities; but in reality they are not cointegrated with each other but both conintegrated with the market. This is known as a confounding variable and it is important to check for market involvement in any relationship you find.\n"
